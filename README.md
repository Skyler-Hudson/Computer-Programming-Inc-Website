# Computer-Programming-Inc-Website
I am currenly learning Front End Web Development (Starting 10/10/2022)
This is the 2nd Personal Project I undertook with my current knowleadge/researched knowleadge about HTML and CSS
This website is really basic because I do not yet know JavaScript, but know enough about HTML and CSS to further my knowleadge about it
The next few projects will include only HTML and CSS until I learn JavaScript
Hope you enjoy this website and can see the progress I make along with me!
